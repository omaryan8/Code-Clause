Developed a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative. Utilized Python and libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Implemented various models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes classifier and evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project involved extensive text preprocessing, model optimization, and visualization of results. Achieved 89%+ accuracy and improved model performance through iterative tuning.
